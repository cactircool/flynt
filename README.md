language I thought would be cool

## TODO

- [_] Register references
- [ ] Resolve references
- [ ] Derive types
- [ ] Backtrack and update function calls/definitions to allow comprehensive named default parameters. Definitions technically allow it, calls just need to allow named default arguments
- [ ] DFS looking for semantic errors
- [ ] Final purely typed tree generation -> IR
