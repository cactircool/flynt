language I thought would be cool

## TODO

- [x] Add spheres and unions of spheres which type members can be statically assigned on definition (its a contract saying, I can only be called on a type instance that belongs to the sphere expression set) <- removed since you can just create a type wrapper with the necessary functions
- [ ] core parser to convert the shell ast into a core ast that can then be optimized and turned into IR
